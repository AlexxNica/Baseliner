Baseliner
======

*All your baseline are belong to us*

**Baseliner** is a Chrome extension for perfectionist Front-End Developers and UX Designers.

This tool will add a grid layer on top of any website to be used as a guidance when developing interfaces. You can set the horizontal guides to match your specification as well as the starting point, in case you're only concerned about individual modules of your site.

New features coming soon!
